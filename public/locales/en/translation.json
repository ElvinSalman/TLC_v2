    "service11":"Air Freight Transportation",
    "service11Txt":"Air transport is currently one of the fastest and most dynamically developing modes of transport. Airway freight is an ideal option, especially for cargo where time matters, items need to be delivered quickly, or are of high value. Cargo transported by air can be delivered very quickly from one place to another. This is especially important for cargo that needs to be delivered in a short period of time (e.g. emergency medical supplies or perishable products). Since air transportation can cover more distances in a short period of time, companies and customers are able to organize their work faster and more efficiently. In particular, this is a great advantage for commercial transportation.",

It is very profitable in the transportation of large volumes of cargo, especially global trade products.

Again, this type of Transportation is the most used and important means of transportation, especially for small and medium volumes of cargo. In freight transport by land, the route and destination are very flexible. Trucks can move in different ways, allowing easy access to different locations, especially areas that are available on roads alone.",
    "service14":"Rail Freight Transportation",

Due to time savings and affordable costs, transportation by rail is in great demand. This type of Transportation is one of the most affordable and reliable means for transporting cargo over long distances and in large volumes. Rail freight transportation is considered as an environmentally friendly alternative, especially in mass freight transportation. Loads of large volumes and weight are easily transported by rail. In particular, the railway is very convenient in the transportation of industrial products, minerals , oil , automobile, technological equipment and other heavy loads.",
